* To produce a project that is inspired by domain-driven design.
* To produce a project that is inspired by the onion architecture design pattern.
* To produce a project where every core business logic is completely independent and isolated from technology.
* To significantly reduce repetitions.
* To increase focus on business problems.
* Can we create our own SIMPLE custom template? And have a generic solution that transforms our custom template into a SAM template?
